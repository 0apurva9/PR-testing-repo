              Once the Exchange process is initiated and the old phone pickup is
              scheduled, the Exchange process cannot be cancelled by the
              customer. However, customer can deny providing the exchange phone

              If in case the customer wishes to return the new mobile phone the
              amount refunded would be after deducting the additional value
              related to exchange. For e.g.: If the price of the new phone is
              Rs. 10,000, Total Exchange Amount is Rs 3000 (Base Value Rs. 2000
              &amp; additional value is Rs. 1000) Customer will get Rs 9000
              (=10,000-1,000) as Refund{" "}

              In case of order cancellation before delivery of new phone, the
              Exchange order will also be cancelled automatically. The Exchange
              order will not be processed independently or without a new mobile
              order

              The customer may have to pay pickup charges towards shipping of
              old phone if mentioned in the checkout page. The pickup charges
              will be over and above the Exchange value of the old phone
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of the customer raising a return request and the refund
              for the same is processed before exchange process completion. The
              customer has received full refund since the exchange is in
              process. In this case if the customer proceeds with exchange, the
              Exchange Cashback credited would be without the "Additional Value"
